    <h2>My Fabulous Frog Find!</h2>
    <p><img src="frog-with-sunglasses-499x538.jpg" alt="A picture of the coolest frog i have seen yet">Today I found the coolest frog. This frog was just outside my house and obviously new how to party. Most days the frogs I find are not wearing clothes of any kind, but this one had the most expensive pair of frog shades I have ever seen. I give the frog an 8/10 for attitude, a 7/10 for athleticism, and a 10/10 for style, giving it an overall 25/30 on my famous frog rating scale.</p>

    <h2>Some Bad News...</h2>
    <p><img src="guitar.jpg" alt="My broken guitar :("> I have some bad news followers. I will no longer be able to write and perform my famous frog songs. I threw a fit when trying to find a rhyme for platypus and destroyed my instrument. If you have freinds that were waiting for my next release, please inform them that I am retiring from the musical part of my career and focusing on the frogs that have inspired me to make this website in the first place.</p>
